# ðŸŒ² Random Forest Classification & Data Analysis

A data science project implemented in **Google Colab** using **Python** to explore, preprocess, and model structured data with a **Random Forest classifier**.  
The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation with visualizations.
